# babel-react-opt-test
Trying to get React 0.14 Babel optimizations to work.

## Instructions

If you're using Node v4.0.0+...
```
npm install
node build
```
If not, include any necessary flags for the `node build` command so that Node
can parse the ES6 syntax in the `build` script.

Then open index.html in the build folder.
